    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
     It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment 
     (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
     its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
 Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
  control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by 
  supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li style="color:rgb(128, 124, 124);"> Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on
         an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>

         <li style="color:rgb(128, 124, 124);">
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information 
            from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
         </li>
</ul>

<p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
<code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
    greetMe("World");</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="constant">
            <header>
                constant
            </header>
            <p>
                You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must
                 start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.  
            </p>
            <code>
                const PI = 3.14;
            </code>
            <p>
                A constant cannot change 
                value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
            </p>
            <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block s
                cope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>


<p>ou cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
<code>/ THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
    CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
    }</code>
    <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
    <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>

<p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>

<u>
    <li style="color:rgb(128, 124, 124) ; text-decoration: none;";

>
        general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW)
    </li>
    <li style="color:rgb(128, 124, 124)";>
        Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
    </li>
    <li style="color:rgb(128, 124, 124)";>
        Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript

<header>Variables</header>
<p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application
    . The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules
    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and 
        the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
        You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in 
            identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
